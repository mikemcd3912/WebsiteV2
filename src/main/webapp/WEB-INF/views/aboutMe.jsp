                    <p class="card-text">I've always had an interest in building, fixing and learning how things work through hands on projects.
                    While this began with an interest in legos or bicycles at a young age and evolved into cars and motorcycles as I got older, I recently learned 
                    that with programming the possibilities for learning are seemlily endless and I can create without needing the budget or space for a project vehicle and parts.

                    <p class="card-text"> When I'm not working on a project of some sort or riding my motorcycle I love getting outdoors. Car camping, Snowshoeing, Backpacking 
                    with my wife or taking my dog Tater tot on walks around the neighborhood are all I've been able to do lately, but I hope to be able to travel to more exotic locations again soon as the world returns to normal.
