                <h3>"The Bike Kollective" Mobile Application</h3>
                <p class="card-text">For my Capstone project in my program at Oregon State University, I created a mobile application with a partner using the Flutter SDK. The application
                    is written in the Dart programming language, and is meant to enable a user to donate a bicycle to the platform so that other users can check the bike out for rides. I 
                    personally contributed the add-a-bike feature and the in-ride features, as well as the app's navigation structure. The add a bike feature included device camera access,
                    storing form data to a firestore noSQL database and GPS to log the location of the donated bike. The in-ride feature included GPS access for determining how far away a 
                    user is from the bike (disabling checkout if the user isn't near enough to a bike to ride it), updating the database upon check out so that it disappears from other rider's 
                    view, a ride stopwatch timer that updates the interface counting down, and a check-in procedure that includes marking the bike as available again for other users and updating
                    the location of the bike in the database. </p>

                <h3>Interactive Shell</h3>
                <p class="card-text">This project was part of my Operating Systems class focusing on multithreading and lower level system interactions. This was my 3rd project 
                    written in C, and it's goal is to closely mimic the command line interface functionality provided in unix systems. The 'small shell' program provides
                    the user the ability to run other programs in the foreground or background using multithreading, redirect input or output of programs being run to files,
                    expand variables found in commands, and run many commands that the standard unix interactive shell has access to. With the Operating Systems class we have been
                    required to only use data types and library functions available in the C99 standard, and compile the program using the gcc compiler.</p>

                <h3>Content Generator Microservice</h3>
                <p class="card-text">This project was made in connection with my Software Engineering I class for OSU, in which we learned about creating a GUI with cognitive style
                    hueristics in mind, using an Agile/Scrum development cycle to do rolling releases to the functionality, and practice how to research and use third
                    party libraries. The project was structured as a Microservice, with the requirement that our service would both call to another classmate's service
                    for data to consume, as well as be available for another Microservice to call upon for data to use. My project was a "Content Generator", which would accept
                    Keywords through the Graphical user interface or a .csv file, and scrape wikipedia for a paragraph relating to those keywords. For my interaction with another 
                    Microservice, I also created functionality with a classmate's service that provided amazon shopping results to show top 10 related products for
                    the provided keywords. To implement this, I utilized the BeautifulSoup library for web-scraping, the Tkinter library for the GUI, and the subprocess library
                    for running the classmate's microservice to produce the shopping results with my keyword inputs</p>

                <p class="card-text">This project was a Full stack website I created with Brittany Leggett in the Introduction to Databases class 
                    from my degree program. The site included a Node.js server running on an AWS EC2 instance, front end functionality for creating 
                    user accounts that were stored in the database, display and filtering of motorcycle ride database values as well as the ability 
                    to log in as an administrator to perform Create/Update/Delete functionalities for the tables in the database. We shared responsibility 
                    for bth the front end and back end, with the majority of my work focusing on back end functionality and database interactions.</p>
